# Amazon Clone - GDSC UGM Batch 2023-2024 Study Case

I have worked on several front-end projects, but most are just vanilla HTML, JS, CSS, and/or SCSS. So, since I have been selected as a Hacker in the first stage of GDSC UGM member recruitment, I took advantage of this opportunity to develop my skills further by choosing the front-end domain as my study case.

I created an Amazon webpage clone that was implemented using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Redux. This is my Kickstarter on learning those tech stacks, and I followed the tutorial from [Jonathan Davies: Amazon Clone in React, Tailwind CSS & Redux [2023]](https://youtu.be/pnnblIo1iO0?si=pgg5Ol8a7bmtyxwN). However, I coded the components line by line by myself while understanding how it worked. I also made some adjustments and improvements from the tutorial given. In summary, these are the list for the features that I implemented:

- Interactive homepage
- Search suggestions
- Shop by best sellers
- Shop by category
- Add to cart with quantity
- Checkout page with increment or decrement items

## How to Run

### Vercel Deployment

I deployed the clone through Vercel and you can access it through this link [https://amazon-clone-lake-two.vercel.app/](https://amazon-clone-lake-two.vercel.app/)

### Local Run

However, if any of the deployments are error, you can run the clone locally by following these steps:

#### 1. Clone the repository to your local directory

Open your terminal on your diesired directory then run this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/alif-muh/amazon-clone.git
```

#### 2. Install the dependencies

Change your directory to `amazon-clone` then run `npm install` to install the dependencies or run this command:

```
cd amazon-clone
npm install
```

#### 3. Run the app

Run the clone on your localhost by running this commad:

```
npm run start
```

Then, access it through [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
